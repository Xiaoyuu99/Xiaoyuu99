## 📖 Academic Projects
### Property risk level prediction for House Insurance company
- Conducted **cost analysis** on redundant inspections, exposing limitations in the current algorithm for identifying at-risk properties.
- Employed **data binning**, **categorical variable encoding**, and **feature engineering** to pinpoint the top ten most influential variables.
- Developed **predictive model** to forcast the risk level for a new coming property based on history inspection data. Implemented machine learning tools including **logistic regression**, **XGBoost** and **random forest** to forecast house condition, optimized current algorithms by **reducing** 80% of redundant inspection cases, predicted to **save** about $421k per year.

### Auto Parts Inventory Optimization with AWS
- Implemented **Amazon S3** to saved the data, **AWS Glue** to extract sample store data, fill missing value, transform string data to category, and do EDA for processed dataset.
- Using **Amazon Sagermaker** to build the predictive model for selling condition and selling quantity for each product, utilized stratified k-folds cross validation to evaluate the accuracy of the model.
- Using **AWS Labmda** to build the optimization model, implemented **pyomo** to get the optimal inventory level for each listed product with the space and feasible revenue constrains.

### NCAA Championship Tickets Sales Prediction
- Pre-processed large amount of data (> 200k) with Python, identified potential patterns behind duration of time and history activity, created new table to track the patterns. Encoded categorical data to prepare for model training.
- Applied machine learning tools including logistic regression, decision tree algorithm, neural network and XGBoost to predict the tickets sales, optimizing towards an accuracy score metrics. Achieved in a model performance of 0.979 in accuracy on the test dataset with XGBoost model.
